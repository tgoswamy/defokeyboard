Repository for results of our paper 'A Keystroke Detection system Using Defocus'
There are 2 video files in this repository. The file 'typing-k-a-n-p-u-r' is a typing demo using the stylus with the corresponding word detection for each keystroke. The file 'defo-finger' is a video showing the dynamic defocus value as the finger traces each edge of the keyboard for obtaining defocus bins.
